Portfolio Project Proposal

Our project will be a website where one can build and view information about a stock portfolio.
One can make an account in a way that is similar to account creation for the Club assignment. 
The login will be done in a similar way, if the information is present in the database they will be directed to a page
 that displays their stock tickers, portfolio value, and cash in their account. 
The database will be queried accordingly depending on what they choose to do with their account. 
This database will store a list or array of stock tickers, name, email, password, amount of cash, portfolio value, etc.

The data about the stocks will be gotten through an HTTP request to the yahoo finance API. 
The API returns information about the stocks in the form of JSON; for our purposes it will be queried for
the current price or close price. Once the JSON is processed and we have the price, 
the person will be able to then buy or sell a certain stock that they queried. 
For further API consumption there will be a live chat box on the right side of the page written 
in JavaScript using the PubNub API.
